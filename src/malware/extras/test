(hey, hey)
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye...
Bye, bye...
Oh, oh.

I'm doin' this tonight,
You're probably gonna start a fight.
I know this can't be right.
Hey, baby, come on.

I loved you endlessly,
When you weren't there for me.
So now it's time to leave
And make it alone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye...

Bye, bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie,
Baby, bye, bye, bye...

Bye, bye
Don't really wanna make it tough,
I just wanna tell you that I had enough.
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie,
Baby, bye, bye, bye

(Oh, oh)

Just hit me with the truth,
Now, girl, you're more than welcome to.
So give me one good reason,
Baby, come on

I live for you and me,
And now I really come to see,
That life would be much better
Once you're gone.

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie,
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye...

Bye, bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie,
Baby, bye, bye, bye...

Bye, bye
Don't really wanna make it tough,
I just wanna tell you that I had enough (ooh, ooh)
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie,
Baby, bye, bye, bye

I'm giving up, I know for sure
I don't wanna be the reason for your love no more
Bye, bye
I'm checkin' out, I'm signin' off
I don't wanna be the loser and I've had enough

I don't wanna be your fool
In this game for two
So I'm leavin' you behind
Bye, bye, bye...

I don't wanna make it tough (wanna make it tough)
But I had enough
And it ain't no lie (bye, bye, baby...)
Bye, bye

I don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two (I don't wanna be your fool)
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye...

Don't really wanna make it tough (don't really wanna make it tough),
I just wanna tell you that I had enough (that I had enough).
Might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie,
Bye, bye, bye
