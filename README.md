# led-airgap
Performing air gap data exfiltration via activity LEDs.

## Motivation
This project attempts to reproduce the [LED-it-go attack][1] from Ben Gurion University, in two parts:
- **Transmitter**: Design malware that permits data transmission via a hard drive activity LED
- **Reciever**: Design an optical receiver that permits data reception and decoding
